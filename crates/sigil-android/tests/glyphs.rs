//! Every character this crate *types* is one the font actually has.
//!
//! # Why a scan and not a list
//!
//! sigil has this check already, as a hand-kept list of the literals somebody
//! remembered to add. It has caught the trap twice -- `✓`, `✓✓` and `↳`
//! shipping as `□`, and `●`/`○` before them -- and it did not catch the third,
//! because the third was in *this* crate, which had no such check, and because
//! a list only covers what was added to it.
//!
//! The third was `("●", theme.accent)` in the Phone tab's capability rows.
//! `●` is not in egui's bundled font, so every capability this phone actually
//! has drew as a tofu box, and the one state somebody opens that pane to
//! confirm read as a rendering fault. Nothing failed: the accessibility tree
//! carries the *string*, which was correct, so every text assertion passed.
//! Only looking at the phone found it.
//!
//! So this reads the crate's own source, takes every non-ASCII character that
//! appears inside a string literal, and asks a real `egui::Context` whether
//! the fonts sigil runs with have it. A literal added tomorrow is covered
//! without anybody adding it anywhere.
//!
//! # What it does not cover
//!
//! It reads characters, so an escape -- `"\u{25CF}"` -- goes straight past
//! it. Checked, not assumed: the control was run both ways, and the escaped
//! form passed while the literal one failed. That is the right trade for now,
//! because nobody writes a dot as an escape; somebody pastes the character
//! in, which is exactly how this shipped three times. If an escape ever does
//! it, the answer is to decode them here rather than to go back to a list.
