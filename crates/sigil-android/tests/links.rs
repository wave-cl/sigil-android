//! Every link in sigil is a control somebody can press.
//!
//! # Why a dependency is what this asserts
//!
//! `ui.hyperlink_to` does not open anything itself. egui emits an
//! `OutputCommand::OpenUrl` and the backend acts on it -- and `egui-winit`'s
//! handler is
//!
//! ```text
//! fn open_url_in_browser(_url: &str) {
//!     #[cfg(feature = "webbrowser")] ...
//!     #[cfg(not(feature = "webbrowser"))] log::warn!("Cannot open url ...");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! That feature comes from eframe's `links`, which is in eframe's *defaults*
//! -- and this workspace builds eframe with `default-features = false`, for
//! wgpu and for the Android backend. `links` was not named, so every link in
//! sigil compiled to a log line, on the phone and on the desktop both. There
//! is no failing render and no error; a link that does nothing looks exactly
//! like one nobody pressed.
//!
//! On Android `webbrowser` goes through `jni` and `ndk-context` -- both of
//! which this crate already carries -- so the intent is started from the
//! activity a NativeActivity registers. That part is unverified on a device;
//! this says only that the code which would do it is in the build.
//!
//! Nothing in a `cargo test` can press a link and watch a browser open. What
//! it *can* do is ask whether the crate that does the opening is in the build
//! at all, which is the whole of what went wrong.
//!
//! # And `cargo metadata` is the wrong question
//!
//! The first version of this read `cargo metadata` for the name. It passed
//! with the feature taken back out, because metadata lists every package in
//! the **lock file** whether the feature resolution reaches it or not -- and
//! the lock still held `webbrowser` from the run before. `cargo tree -i`
//! walks the resolved graph and exits 101 when nothing depends on the
//! package, which is the difference between "it is written down somewhere"
//! and "it is compiled in".
